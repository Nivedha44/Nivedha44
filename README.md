## Hi there 👋
Welcome. I work with clinical data using both SAS and R, and this GitHub showcases how I build the same clinical study workflows side by side in both languages. The idea is simple: take one clinical data problem and solve it in SAS and R with clear, comparable logic.

🔭 I’m currently building parallel SAS and R pipelines for clinical-style studies, from raw data to analysis-ready datasets.
🌱 I’m continuously growing in CDISC and SDTM standards, data transformation strategies, and workflow optimization.

Across the repositories you’ll find:

• Side by side SAS and R code for the same study scenarios
• Clinical data cleaning, derivations, and transformation workflows
• CDISC and SDTM-style structuring and mapping logic
• Validation checks and analysis-ready dataset creation
• Reusable, well-commented code so the flow is easy to follow

💬 Ask me about SAS vs R approaches, clinical data workflows, and validation logic. If you’re interested in collaborating on clinical data projects, I’m open to connecting.

Life is a sine wave. With the peaks and troughs, the curve only moves forward. Let's goooooo!!
